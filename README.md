# Leetcode
Contains solutions to the problems I solved

All the files I uploaded initially will be in ".txt". Later on I when I started coding and pushing to the repo I did it with ".py" extension.

I have labelled the file names by the problem number so that it is easy to spot a problem. The name of the problem is given in the commit message
